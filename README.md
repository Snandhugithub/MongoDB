# Prerequisties
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

1.MongoDB
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

2.Visual Studio Code
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3.Node.js
https://nodejs.org/

# Technologies Used
             Node.js
             Express.js
             MongoDB
             Handlebars(hbs)

# Frontend Specifications
The frontend used for tourism database id hbs(Handlebars). 
Handlebars is a popular templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content. It allows you to create reusable templates with placeholders that can be filled in with data during runtime. Handlebars is often used in web development to generate HTML views dynamically based on data from MongoDB databases . Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions and also javascript. Javascript can update and change both HTML and CSS . Javasript can also calculate, manipulate and validate the data.

# Backend Specification 
The backend used for tourism management project is node.js, mondodb-atlas and mongodb compass.

Node.js :

Node. js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language.

Mongodb-atlas :

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB, the company behind the MongoDB database. It offers a simple and scalable way to host, manage, and deploy MongoDB databases in the cloud.
MongoDB Atlas simplifies the management and deployment of MongoDB databases in the cloud, providing a scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure for your applications. It is suitable for a wide range of use cases, from small-scale applications to large, high-traffic systems, and offers flexibility to adapt to evolving business needs.

Mongodb compass :

MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool provided by MongoDB for interacting with MongoDB databases. It offers a visual interface to explore, analyze, and manipulate your data, making it easier for developers and administrators to work with MongoDB.

# CRUD Operation
       Create: Users can easily create new records by filling out forms or providing necessary details through API requests. The application ensures data integrity and validation before saving it to the database.
  
       Read: The application provides efficient and optimized retrieval of data from the MongoDB database. Users can fetch specific records based on criteria, such as filtering by specific fields or querying with specific parameters.
  
       Update: Users have the ability to update existing records, modifying specific fields or updating the entire record altogether. The application handles data validation and ensures consistency in the updated information.
  
       Delete: This application allows users to remove records from the database, providing a seamless way to delete unwanted or outdated data. It ensures proper handling of related data dependencies and maintains referential integrity.
